Folder structure: 
- Each task has an 'original' folder for the original syntoolkit code, which also have subfolders for getting these running in browsers.
- Each task also has a 'new' folder, with a version which runs in the browser and a version which runs in lab.js. these are very similar.
- The root folder also contains some templates which are useful for converting html/js into lab.js friendly code.
- note the 'browser' versions can be run in your browser by just opening the html file in those folders.
